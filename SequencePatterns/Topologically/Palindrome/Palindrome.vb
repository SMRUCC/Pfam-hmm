    ''' === Palindromic hexamers ===
    ''' For a given sequence, any palindrome of 6 nt (e.g., AAATTT) Is given a value of 1, while 
    ''' all bases Not included inpalindromic hexamers are given a value of 0 (van et al. 2003).

    ''' === Inverted Repeats ===
    ''' Local Inverted repeats are found by taking a 100 bp sequence window, And looking For the 
    ''' best match Of a 30 bp piece withinthat window, On the opposite strand, In the opposite 
    ''' direction (Jensen et al. 1999). 
    ''' Values can range from 0 (no match at all)To 1 (one Or more perfect match within the window).

    ''' === Quasi-palindromes ===
    ''' "Quasi-palindromes" are short inverted repeats, which are found by taking a 30 bp piece of sequence, 
    ''' And looking for matcheswith at least 6 out of 7 nt matching, on the opposite strand, in the opposite 
    ''' direction (van et al. 2003). Values canrange from 0 (no match at all) to 1 (one Or more perfect

    ''' === Simple Repeats ===
    ''' A "simple repeat" Is a region which contains a simple oligonucleotide repeat, Like microsattelites. 
    ''' Simple repeats are foundby looking for tandem repeats of length R within a 2R-bp window. 
    ''' By using the values 12, 14, 15, 16, And 18 for R, allsimple repeats of lengths 1 through 9 are calculated, 
    ''' of length of at least 24 bp (Jensen et al. 1999). Values can range from 0(no match at all) to 1 
    ''' (one Or more perfect match within the window).

    ''' 
    ''' === GC Skew ===
    ''' For many genomes there Is a strand bias, such that one strand tends To have more G's, 
    ''' whilst the other strand has more C's.This GC-skew bias can be measured the number of G's 
    ''' minus the number of C's over a fixed length (e.g. 10,000 bp) of DNA(Jensen et al. 1999). 
    ''' The values can range from +1 (all G's on the examined sequence, with all C's on the other strand), 
    ''' to -1(the reverse case - all C's on the examined sequence, and all G's on the other strand). 
    ''' There is a correlation with GC-skewand the replication leading and lagging strands.

    ''' 
    ''' === Percent AT ===
    ''' The percent AT Is a running average Of the AT content, over a given window size. Typically For a bacterial 
    ''' genomes Of about5 Mbp, the window size Is 10,000 bp. The Percent AT can range from 0 (no AT content) To 1 (100% AT). 
    ''' The Percent AT iscorrelated With other DNA structural features, such that AT rich regions are often more readily 
    ''' melted, tend To be lessflexible And more rigid, although they can also be readily compacted chromatin proteins (Pedersen et al. 2000).
